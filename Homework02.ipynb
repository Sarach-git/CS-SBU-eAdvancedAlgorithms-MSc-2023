        "> To determine the maximum possible score we can achieve if we move first, we can use a brute force approach. In this approach, we iterate through all possible subsets of scores. At each step, we can either choose the first or last score from the remaining subset and remove it permanently, obtaining its score. The opponent also has the same options. After each selection, we recursively call the same function for the updated subset and store the path and score obtained. Finally, we select the subset with the maximum score and print the corresponding path. It's worth noting that when we have only two scores remaining, we simply choose the score with the higher value. This algorithm exhaustively considers all possible states and selects the subset with the highest score.\n",

        "> A smart strategy to achieve an optimal solution for this problem is by using dynamic programming. The main idea is to break down the problem into smaller subproblems and then build up to the main solution. The general solution involves using a two-dimensional array to store the maximum possible score that can be obtained from each subset of the input sequence. In each cell `(i, j)` of the array, we store the maximum score that can be obtained by selecting either the first or last element from the subsequence starting at position `i` and ending at position `j`. By setting `i` to `0` and `j` to the length of the input sequence minus one, we can obtain the overall solution to the problem. Initially, we fill all cells of the two-dimensional array with zeros, and then, in a loop, we consider the scores obtained by selecting the leftmost or rightmost element and choose the optimal move using maximum value selection. It's important to note that the solution takes into account that the opponent also plays optimally. The final result obtained is an optimal score considering the optimal gameplay of both players, and even higher scores can be obtained if the opponent doesn't play optimally.\n",
