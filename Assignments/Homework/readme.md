# Policies 

- **Late policy:** You have one late credit. If you use the credit, you can submit a homework or a project 3 days late. No other late submissions will be accepted.  

- **Collaboration policy:** For homework problems, you are allowed to discuss with classmates. However, it is highly recommended that you first 
think about each problem for enough time before the discussion. 
You must write your solutions by yourself, in your own words.
